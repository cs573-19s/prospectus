# Research project prospectus - Education funding and undergraduates in different provinces in China

Abstract / Introduction.
----
We analyse the educational funding and undergraduate population in each province in China at National Bureau of Statistics of China(http://data.stats.gov.cn/) and found exponential increasing of the two attributes while the funding per undergraduate was fluctuating. It may reflect the focus changing from quantity to quality towards education in different areas. For example, a new policy from government: In 1985, the government abolished tax-funded higher education, requiring university applicants to compete for scholarships based on academic ability. In the early 1980s the government allowed the establishment of the first private institution of higher learning, increasing the number of undergraduates and people who hold doctoral degrees fivefold from 1995 to 2005.

Describe your project in one sentence.
----
Visulize the education funding & undergraduate population in different area in a China map from 1993 to 2017.

What type of project is this and why?
----
Data Analysis & Data Visualization 

Who is the audience for this project? How does it meet their needs? What happens if their needs remain unmet?
----
The educators, politicians and every family whose child is or is going to be an undergraduate. It can show the educational funding weighted in different areas to help educators and politicians to make reasonable decisions and the tendency of the education focus in different area to help the people going to be an undergraduate to choose universities.

What is your approach and why do you think itâ€™s cool and will be successful?
----
Using unsupervised machine learning to cluster the educational funding in different provinces in China is innovative.
Using d3 to visualize the educational funding and undergraduates in a Chinese map with timeline and interactive subchart to show details the map cannot present is really cool(I think).

In the best-case scenario, what would be the impact statement (conclusion statement) for this project?
----
In the best-case scenario, it will help Chinese Government to make correct choice towards education and help Chinese high school students to choose promising university.

List all major milestones for this project.
----
- Geting the dataset and purify it finished on April 10, 2019
- Initially plot to find the tendency of the funding and undergraduates on April 11, 2019

What obstacles do you anticipate?
----
Never use data visualization in a map. 
How to connect the data with a figure? 
Which visualize script do we need to use?

What additional resources do you need to complete this project?
----
How to make data visualization in a map.

List 5 major publications that are most relevant to this project, and how they are related.

When / How do you know if you have succeeded in this project?
----
1. We show the data in a Chinese map and it can play automatically with the timeline goes by.
2. When we click a certain province we can get the sub curve chart of its education funding changing and the undergraduates changing.
3. The lightness of a province to show the ratio of education funding and undergraduate population.
